# Description
This is just a dead simple carousel implementation in Angular and TypeScript that uses the Angular UI Bootstrap components from here: https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/

There are really just three pieces:
1. app.js that boostraps (and injects the dependency on bootstrap UI)
2. HTML view that links to the controller with the carousel's data and timer interval
3. A controller that gets some cat pictures
